# Secure-cloud-using-cryptography
Nowadays, security in cloud is a rising issue. Since the majority of companies changing their old ways of storing data from traditional to Cloud storage, data security is a main hitch in adopting cloud computing for many organizations. With the advancements in modern technology and easy access to the internet, traditional methods such as the Caesar Cipher were not a huge bottleneck in front of cryptanalysts or adversaries who like to break into a system or message just for the sake of pride, enjoyment or fame. The aim of this project is to develop a secure cloud storage application for Google Drive, box, Dropbox etc. We are designing a suitable key management system for our application to share files securely.

Need of data security is an essential issue in the domain of computing traditionally. Also there has been a tremendous increase in the usage of cloud storage for storing files and these files are prone to leakage. There has to be a solution, and encryption of files is the only way. Our motive is to develop a system which encrypts the files in our cloud and decrypts when it is downloaded to the local system.

Objective:-

->The main objective of this project is to make files more secure using hybrid encryption.

->To develop an application which takes a file to encrypt and upload it on the cloud storage so even if there is a data breach the file is seen in encrypted form only and original data is unknown

->To also extend the feature of downloading the uploaded file from the cloud and decrypt the file without altering the original contents of the uploaded file.
